# SpeciesClassificationApp

Context: The reason I did this was from my family. My cousin was just born almost 8 months ago, and my uncle and aunt are confused in choosing which kind of source to teach him about letters, animals, etc. Based on my experience, I believe there is no way that we can learn better than looking at the images and define what are the differences between those animals. Therefore, I decided to create this in order to classify animals.

Software: Markup: * Swift Language
                  * CreateML
                  * XCode
          Using the small-scale of images (35 images/type of animal), I then let them be trained by **CreateML** in **XCode**.

Output: It runs successfully with different kind of tests.
